## Usage
1. **Run the notebook:** Execute the `air_temprature_prediction_ml.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.  This performs data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training (using Random Forest, Linear Regression, and LightGBM), hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

2. **Examine results:** The notebook outputs visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, learning curves) during EDA and model evaluation.  Numerical results (RMSE, MAE, R-squared) for each model are displayed in the notebook's output.  A series of bar charts compare the performance of the different models across various metrics and configurations (with/without feature selection and hyperparameter tuning).  The notebook also provides a legend to interpret the model names.

## Features
- **Air Temperature Prediction:** Predicts next-day minimum air temperature using machine learning.
- **Data Exploration and Visualization:**  Loads, cleans, and visualizes the dataset using various plots (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps) to understand data distribution, trends, and relationships between features.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values (mean/median imputation) and outliers (IQR and Z-score methods).
- **Feature Engineering:** Creates new features from existing ones (e.g., year, month, season, daily temperature range).
- **Feature Selection:** Employs feature selection techniques (Sequential Feature Selection (SFS), Sequential Backward Selection (SBS), SelectKBest) to identify the most relevant features for prediction.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Trains and evaluates multiple regression models (Random Forest, Linear Regression, LightGBM) using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Uses GridSearchCV to optimize model hyperparameters.
- **Learning Curve Analysis:** Plots learning curves to assess model performance and identify potential overfitting.
- **Model Comparison:** Compares the performance of different models and feature selection strategies.
